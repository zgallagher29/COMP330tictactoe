TIC TAC TOE GAME

THAER MOHAMAD, COLLIN YAN, MICHAEL WOELFEL


INTRODUCTION:

We made a tic tac toe game, a pencil game on a computer for two players. There is a 3x3 grid and whenever a player crosses out three boxes first, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

PROCESS:

At first, communicating was hard because thaer just joined our team and we didnt get to see him until the second week of class and its our first time using basecamp. But after we exchanged numbers and emails, we made google docs for our ideas and material. We met with a tutor whenever we had a problem with our code or contacted the TA. It was very easy working together because we each had a specialty area regarding the project and would help each other until completion. 

REQUIRMENTS

Functional:

-Display user's name and decide who goes first
	-First move is X and then O and then repeats

-Check win conditions, starting on the fifth turn or when a player makes their third move
-Identify when there's a tie or no one wins

-Allow the players to choose if they want to play again 

Nonfunctional:

-3x3 grid
	-All cells begin blank 

-Game board that keeps track of the inputs of the two players 
- we'll potentially need two, one to keep track and take in player input, the other to display to the players.

-Game board resets when it's over so user can play again.

Issues weve encountered:

-When the game asks for inputs for ints and to play again it would give an error if the types don't match.
-It took us sometime to include the draw as a result, when both players would fill the boxes up but not win.
-When the game would end, it wouldnt include the winner. We tweaked the code to include it and it wouldnt.

Bugs:

We encountered one bug and it was with our while loop. Originally the while loop was meant to stop the code after there is a winner but it doesn't. The code keeps repeating.
